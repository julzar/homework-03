Assignment: Create a javascript program (using the provided HTML and css) that prompts the user for inputs and then genereates a random password based on their choices.

Program uses the browser's default prompt, comfirm, and alert events such that:

when the generate password button is clicked, the user is prompted to enter a desired password length from 8-128 characters.
If they click 'cancel', the program stops.
If they enter an invalid number (<8, >128, non-numeric character), they are prompted again.
If they enter a valid number, they must click 'confirm' or 'cancel' (yes, no) for four choices of character types to include in the password: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numberic characters, and special characters.
If they click 'cancel' on all four, the choices are presented again.
If at least one choice has been confirmed after all four have been presented, a password of the chosen length is generated using random characters from the selected character sets.
The user is alerted that their password has been generated, and when they click 'ok' the password apears in the box above the generate password button.
